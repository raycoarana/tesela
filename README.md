Tesela
======

Tesela is a code generate based library that helps you implement Model-View-Presenter pattern
on Android. It let you annotate methods to make them be executed on UI thread or on a background
thread. It will help you to keep a weak reference to the view, so forget about leaking your
Fragment or Activity anymore while your background work finishes.

How to use it?
--------------

The first thing to do is to initialize Tesela providing it a TeselaEecutor implementation.
That way you can control where background work will be executed, how many threads are created,
use an standard Java thread pool or other kind of thread pool.

```java
public class SampleApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        final Handler mainThreadHandler = new Handler();
        final Executor backgroundExecutor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        Tesela.init(new TeselaExecutor() {
                    
                        @Override
                        public boolean isMainCurrentThread() {
                            return Looper.myLooper() == Looper.getMainLooper();
                        }
                    
                        @Override
                        public void executeInUIThread(Runnable runnable) {
                            mainThreadHandler.post(runnable);
                        }
                    
                        @Override
                        public void executeInBackground(Runnable runnable) {
                            executeInBackground(runnable, null);
                        }
                    
                        @Override
                        public void executeInBackground(Runnable runnable, String tag) {
                            backgroundExecutor.execute(runnable);
                        }
                    
                    });
    }

}
```

Once you have Tesela initialized, you just have to annotate your classes, the first thing is annotate
your view interface with the @View annotation.

```java
@View
public interface HelloWorldView {
    void showMessage(String message);
}
```

Then on your presenter, annotate your view attribute and change it's type to WeakXXXX, where
XXXX is the name of the view interface. This class will hold a weak reference to your view
and will have all methods of your interface, so you don't have to deal with the weak reference.

```java
public class HelloWorldPresenter {

    @ViewReference
    protected WeakHelloWorldView mView;

    public void onInitialize(HelloWorldView view) {
        mView = WeakHelloWorldView.of(view);
    }
    
...    
```

Now simply annotate methods that needs to be executed on a background thread with @Background
and methods that needs to be executed in UI thread with @UI.

```java
    @Background
    protected void onDoSomething() {
        //Do some hard work here

        refreshView();
    }

    @UI
    protected void refreshView() {
        mView.showMessage("HelloWorld");
    }
```

Finally in your DI framework make sure every time you inject your presenter, the generated
presenter by Tesela is injected instead.

```java
    @Provides
    protected HelloWorldPresenter provideHelloWorldPresenter(TeselaHelloWorldPresenter impl) {
        return impl;
    }
```
